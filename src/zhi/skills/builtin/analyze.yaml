  - Length and structure summary
  - Primary language

  - Main topics and themes
  - Key arguments or claims made
  - Important data points, figures, or statistics mentioned

  ## Structure Analysis

  - Logical flow assessment
  - Missing sections or gaps

  ## Actionable Takeaways
  - Key decisions or actions implied by the document
  - Questions the document raises but does not answer
  - Recommended follow-up steps
